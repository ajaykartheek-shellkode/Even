Service extraction verification steps:\n   - Cross-reference the number of extracted services with any service count mentioned in the invoice\n   - Verify that the sum of individual service amounts matches any subtotals provided\n   - Check for service codes/IDs that might indicate separate billable items\n\n3. Data quality requirements:\n   - Convert all numeric amounts to numbers (not strings)\n   - Use null for missing string fields, 0 for missing numeric fields\n   - Preserve original date formats exactly as found\n   - Extract complete facility information including address and contact details\n   - Identify medical departments: \"radiology\", \"pharmacy\", \"consultation\", \"laboratory\", \"pathology\", \"surgery\", \"emergency\", \"other\"\n</EXTRACTION_GUIDELINES>\n\n<SERVICE_IDENTIFICATION_GUIDE>\nLook for services in these common formats:\n1.
