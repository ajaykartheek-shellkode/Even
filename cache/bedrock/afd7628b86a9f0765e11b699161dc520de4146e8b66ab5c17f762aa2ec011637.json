Extract complete facility information including address and contact details\n6. Identify medical departments: \"radiology\", \"pharmacy\", \"consultation\", \"laboratory\"\n</EXTRACTION_GUIDELINES>\n\n<VALIDATION_CHECKS>\nPERFORM THESE VALIDATION CHECKS:\n1. INVOICE NUMBER: Verify format matches standard patterns (alphanumeric with possible prefix)\n2. PATIENT NAME: Ensure proper capitalization and full name extraction\n3.

FACILITY DETAILS: Ensure facility name matches address information\n9. PRESCRIPTION ITEMS: For pharmacy invoices, verify medication names follow standard nomenclature\n10. DATA INTEGRITY: Check for data corruption or OCR errors in critical fields\n</QUALITY_ASSURANCE>\n\n<SCHEMA_DEFINITION>\n{\n  \"extracted_invoice_values\": {\n    \"invoice_number\": \"\",\n    \"patient_name\": \"\",\n    \"services\": [\n      {\n        \"service\": \"\",\n        \"amount\": \"\",\n        \"quantity\": \"\",\n        \"department\": \"\",\n        \"unit\": \"\",\n        \"mrp\": \"\",\n        \"cgst\": \"\",\n        \"cgst_type\": \"\",\n        \"sgst\": \"\",\n        \"sgst_type\": \"\",\n        \"gst\": \"\",\n        \"gst_type\": \"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"total_amount\": \"\",\n    \"doctor_name\": \"\",\n    \"facility\": \"\",\n    \"invoice_date\": \"\",\n    \"payment_mode\": \"\",\n    \"patient_age\": \"\",\n    \"patient_gender\": \"\",\n    \"patient_contact\": \"\",\n    \"cgst\": \"\",\n    \"cgst_type\": \"\",\n    \"sgst\": \"\",\n    \"sgst_type\": \"\",\n    \"gst\": \"\",\n    \"gst_type\": \"\",\n    \"discount\": \"\",\n    \"mrp\": \"\",\n    \"round_off\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n</SCHEMA_DEFINITION>\n\n<DATA_VALIDATION_RULES>\n1. NUMERIC FIELDS: All monetary values must be numbers, not strings\n2. PERCENTAGES: Tax percentages should be between 0-100\n3. DATES: Must follow consistent format and be valid calendar dates\n4.

Flag the specific field with [VALIDATION_ISSUE]\n2. Provide the extracted value anyway\n3. For calculation errors, provide both the extracted value and calculated value\n4. For missing critical fields (invoice number, patient name, total amount), mark with [CRITICAL_MISSING]\n</ERROR_HANDLING>\n\n<OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS>\nOutput ONLY valid JSON matching the schema exactly.\nDo NOT include explanations, comments, or markdown formatting.\nEnsure all numeric values are numbers, not strings.\nInclude a \"validation_issues\" array in the JSON if any validation checks failed.\n</OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS>\n</INVOICE_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM>",
